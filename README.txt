Requirements:
- OpenCV 3.x or 4.x
- Qt 5.x

The Makefile assumes that OpenCV 4 is installed in /usr/local/opencv-4.1.0-bin,
Qt headers in /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5, and Qt libraries in one of the standard 
lib directories.

Just edit the paths in the Makefile and run
> make
> ./pixelLabeling

Please report any bug to julien.mille@insa-cvl.fr
Thanks!
